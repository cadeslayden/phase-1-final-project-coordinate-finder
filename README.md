# **COORDINATE FINDER**
## A SIMPLE SINGLE PAGED APPLICATION FOR FINDING COUNTY COORDINATES 📍
#
#### COORDINATE FINDER WAS CREATED FOR FLATIRON SCHOOLS PHASE-1-PORTFOLIO PROJECT. THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT WAS TO CREATE AN (SPA) SINGLE-PAGED-APPLICATION THAT USES A PUBLIC API TO RETREIVE SOME SORT OF OBJECT THAT IS THAN USED IN YOUR APP. I DECIDED TO USE A GET REQUEST TO AN API THAT TAKES IN A COUNTY NAME AND RETURNS INFORMATION REGARDING THE COORDINATES OF SAID COUNTY.
