# **COORDINATE FINDER**üìçüß≠
## A SIMPLE SINGLE PAGED APPLICATION FOR FINDING COUNTY COORDINATES 
#
# OVERVIEW üîç
#
### COORDINATE FINDER WAS CREATED FOR FLATIRON SCHOOLS PHASE-1-PORTFOLIO PROJECT. THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT WAS TO CREATE AN (SPA) SINGLE-PAGED-APPLICATION THAT USES A PUBLIC API TO RETREIVE SOME SORT OF OBJECT THAT IS THAN USED IN YOUR APP. I DECIDED TO USE A GET REQUEST TO AN API THAT TAKES IN A COUNTY NAME AND RETURNS INFORMATION REGARDING THE COORDINATES OF SAID COUNTY.

## INSPIRATION üå≤
#
### BEING BORN AND RAISED IN MONTANA, THE OUTDOORS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG PART OF MY LIFE. GROWING UP, I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED BY GEOGRAPHY. SO WHEN I HAD TO COME UP WITH A PORTFOLIO PROJECT IDEA, I WANTED IT TO PERTAIN TO SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. AFTER BRAINSTORMING FOR DAYS ON END, I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA. EVER WONDER WHAT THE COORDINATES OF YOUR COUNTY ARE! WELL YOU'RE IN LUCK, NOW ITS EASIER THAN EVER. SIMPLY TYPE IN YOUR COUNTY NAME AND WAIT FOR THE RESPONSE!
